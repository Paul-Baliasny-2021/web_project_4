# Project 4: Around The U.S.

* This project imitates interactive social media page where users can update their profile and add pictures and descriptions of places they travelled in the USA.

* The project uses media query CSS technique to provide horizontal scrollbar-free usage on all modern screens, as well as basic JavaScript code to allow a user their personal profile editing.

* The project will be further developed to provide some more realistic interactivity such as adding place cards and their description, liking other users' posts etc.
